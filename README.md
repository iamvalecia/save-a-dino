# Save-A-Dino

This is the repository for my finished game Save-a-Dino, a frogger-styled game where you help a little dinosaur not go extinct.
It's made using the [Phaser 3](https://www.phaser.io/phaser3) framework. And it requires a keyboard to play. 

**Game Instructions**

Your dino can only move left and right using the two controls--left arrow and right arrow. The goal of the game is to capture all the food sources. There are 10. The food will always appear on the opposite side of the screen from the last food source. Your dino has to dodge asteroids to get there. Food sources give you 3 points each. Get hit by a small asteroid, lose one point. Get hit by a big asteroid, lose five points. Do not let your score fall below zero and try to get the highest!
